[Email Me](mailto:sburns77@gmail.com?Subject=Hello!), review my [recent projects](http://github.io/simonburns77) or look at my [résumé](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=64958284) I'm Canadian, we have to use the French spelling.

Here's my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/saywhatSimon),[Twitter](https://twitter.com/realSimonBurns) and [instagram](https://twitter.com/realSimonBurns).

I'm a huge fan of financial technology. Not entirely sure why, I started investing in markets fairly young (like 13). I like to write about how fintech is changing the way that people invest. And how the way people invest changes how capital is allocated. Which changes how innovation gets funded. Which changes how society advances. I like the way that all works out.
